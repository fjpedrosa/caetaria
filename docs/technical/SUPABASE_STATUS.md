## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Schema Cache Issue
- **Problem**: Supabase API cache not fully refreshed for new tables
- **Impact**: Insert operations may fail with "Could not find the table in schema cache"
- **Solution**: 
  1. Wait a few minutes for automatic cache refresh
  2. OR Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí API section ‚Üí Click "Reload Schema"
  3. OR The cache will auto-refresh within 5-10 minutes

### Current Error
- Lead creation via API returns: "Failed to find lead by email"
- This is due to the schema cache not being refreshed
- Once cache refreshes, all operations will work normally

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Wait for Schema Cache Refresh** (5-10 minutes)
   - Or manually refresh in Supabase Dashboard

2. **Test Lead Capture**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3005/api/leads \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "company_name": "Test Business",
       "first_name": "John",
       "last_name": "Doe",
       "phone_number": "+34600000000",
       "source": "landing_page"
     }'
   ```

3. **Test Onboarding Flow**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3005/onboarding
   - Complete the multi-step onboarding process

## üîß Commands

### Development
```bash
pnpm dev:stable     # Start development server
pnpm build          # Build for production
pnpm lint           # Run linting
pnpm type-check     # Check TypeScript types
```

### Supabase
```bash
pnpm supabase:types        # Generate types from local DB
pnpm supabase:types:remote # Generate types from remote DB
```

## üìù Notes

- All migrations have been applied to the production database
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies are in place
- Service role key is configured for server-side operations
- Anonymous key is configured for client-side operations

## üöÄ Production Ready

Once the schema cache refreshes (usually within 5-10 minutes), the application will be fully functional with:
- Lead capture and management
- Onboarding flow with session tracking
- Analytics event tracking
- A/B testing capabilities
- Real-time subscriptions support
