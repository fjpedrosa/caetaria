 * - Hardcoded message sequence and timing
 * - Inline WhatsApp Flow implementation
 * - Hardcoded educational badges system
 * - Complex useEffect chains for timing
 * - Inline iPhone UI implementation
 * - No reusability or extensibility
 *
 * AFTER (hero-mobile-demo-v3.tsx - Target):
 * - <100 lines of clean, declarative code
 * - Uses modular WhatsApp Simulator system
 * - Reusable scenario configuration
 * - Clean architecture with separation of concerns
 * - Extensible for future scenarios
 * - Better maintainability
 * - Same visual output and behavior
 * - 90%+ code reduction while maintaining all features
 *
 * Benefits:
